Read 22.3 of OpenStax Astronomy 2e.  This will give you a brief introduction to stellar clusters and how they can appear on the H-R diagram (luminosity vs color):

BTW, you can also read 18.4 if you'd like to fill in some gaps that may be left in your understanding of H-R diagrams and why they're useful.

Then work through the included notebook, filling in where prompted, and upload your completed notebook.
